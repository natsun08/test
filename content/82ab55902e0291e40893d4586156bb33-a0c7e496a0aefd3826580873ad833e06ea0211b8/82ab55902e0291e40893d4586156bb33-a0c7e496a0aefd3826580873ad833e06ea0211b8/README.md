# OpenAI API in JupyterLite

Both of these examples require an API key, and neither really do anything at present.

You can drag them into just about any JupyterLite site, such as JupyterLite's own [ReadTheDocs](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/) or [demo](https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo).
